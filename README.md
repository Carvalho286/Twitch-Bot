# Twitch Bot

A simple and customizable bot for Twitch streaming!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To set up your bot, ensure that you have **Node.js** installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installation

1. **Install Node Modules**  
   Open the command line, navigate to the directory where you want to create the bot, and run:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

2. **Open Your Code Editor**
   Use any preferred editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom) to open your project directory.

3. **Add the Provided Files**
   Place all provided bot files in your project directory.

4. **Configure the BOT**
   Open `index.js` in your editor and make any necessary adjustments to customize the bot settings.

5. **Create Custom Commands**
   Navigate to the `commands` folder to add or edit commands. Each command file name (e.g., `afk.js`) will act as the command itself; for example, a file named `afk.js` will be triggered in the Twitch chat by typing `!afk`.

6. **Start the Bot**
   Run the `start-bot.bat` file, and your bot will be live and ready to use on Twitch!
